# Roll-the-Dice
Through the creation of the Roll the Dice page, I have showcased my ability to proficiently use JavaScript to generate random numbers and manipulate HTML elements. By incorporating external libraries and tools, and applying CSS to enhance the page's visual appeal, I have demonstrated practical skills in web development. 

This project has allowed me to apply programming concepts and tools to create interactive user experiences and problem-solve when necessary. I am confident that my ability to innovate and showcase my knowledge of JavaScript and related technologies will be an asset in any web development setting.
